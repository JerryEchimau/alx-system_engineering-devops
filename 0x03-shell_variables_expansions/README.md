# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
In this project, we learnt about Shell Initialization files, variables, and expansions <br>
Here are the tasks in the project:

## Tasks
### 0. <o>
- Creating an alias has a simple syntax: ``alias alias_name='command'``

### 1. Hello you
- This is the expansion of ``USER`` where we use ``$`` to expand the variable

### 2. The path to success is to take massive, determined action
- We will use ``export`` to mark the variable PATH for export to the environment
- The syntax is ``export VARIABLE_NAME=value``

### 3. If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads
- Here, we can print out the PATH, then truncate/replace each ':' with a new line(\n), then count each line

### 4. Global variables
- ``printenv`` prints all environment variables

### 5. Local variables
- ``set`` can be used to display shell variables and functions

### 6. Local variable
- just define the varibalbe as the value

### 7. Global variable
- we use ``export`` for global variables set in the environment

### 8. Every addition to true knowledge is an addition to human power
- here, we use expansion and arithmentic expansions

### 9. Divide and rule
- similar to the previous one, we use expansion and arithmentic expansion

### 10. Love is anterior to life, posterior to death, initial of creation, and the exponent of breath
- We use expansion as well

### 11. There are 10 types of people in the world -- Those who understand binary, and those who don't
- here, we useboth arithmetic expansion and base prefix '#' to convert

### 12. Combination
- For this one, we use the brace expansion {} and use inverse of grep to select non matching lines to oo

### 13. Floats
- to print a number in two decimal place, we use the ``print`` function format ``%.2f``
